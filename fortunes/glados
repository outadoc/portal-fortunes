Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment 
center.
%
We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
%
Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper.
%
Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the 
primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur.
%
For your own safety and the safety of others, please refrain from-- [bzzzzzt]
%
Por favor bord√≥n de fallar Muchos gracias de fallar gracias
%
stand back. The portal will open in three, two, one.
%
Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test.
%
First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.
%
This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any 
unauthorized equipment that passes through it - for instance, the Aperture 
Science Weighted Storage Cube.
%
Please do not attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area.
%
A replacement Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube will be delivered shortly.
%
Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture 
Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.
%
Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged 
exposure to the Button are not part of this test.
%
You're doing very well!
%
Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test 
protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material 
Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi- rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, 
crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
%
Very good! You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal 
Device.
%
With it, you can create your own portals.
%
These intra-dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe.
%
The Device, however, has not.
%
Do not touch the operational end of The Device.
%
Do not look directly at the operational end of The Device.
%
Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially.
%
Most importantly, under no circumstances should you-
%
Please proceed to the chamberlock. Mind the gap.
%
Well done! Remember: The Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is 
the perfect time to have her tested.
%
Welcome to test chamber four.
%
You're doing quite well.
%
Once again, excellent work.
%
As part of a required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. 
You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.
%
Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe 
performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself 
permanently inside this room.
%
A complimentary escape hatch will open in 3, 2, 1.
%
As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we 
would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.
%
Good job! As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth 
in three, two, [static].
%
While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science High 
Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent 
disabilities, such as vaporization.
%
Please be careful.
%
Unbelievable! You, [Subject Name Here], must be the pride of [Subject Hometown 
Here].
%
Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, alarms and 
flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and 
have therefore been disabled for your safety.
%
Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the 
chamberlock.
%
Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the 
chamber floor will result in an 'unsatisfactory' mark on your official testing 
record followed by death. Good luck!
%
Very impressive. Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device 
to enhance your testing experience.
%
The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.
%
Make no attempt to solve it.
%
The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.
%
Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the 
occasion of this unsolvable test environment.
%
Frankly, this chamber was a mistake. If we were you, we would quit now.
%
No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a 
perfectly reasonable response.
%
Quit now and cake will be served immediately.
%
Fantastic! You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme 
pessimism.
%
Hello again. To reiterate [slows down] our previous [speeds up] warning: This 
test [garbled speech] -ward momentum.
%
Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or 
to be more precise, how it does not.
%
Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In 
layman's terms: Speedy-thing goes in, speedy-thing comes out.
%
The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.
%
In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always 
provide useful advice.
%
For instance, the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it.
%
The Device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals 
at once.
%
As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact:
%
The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of 
everyone in Subject Hometown Here.
%
(garble) fling yourself. (garble) fling into sp- [bzzt]
%
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee[bzzt]
%
Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, 
VERY, long time.
%
If you become light-headed from thirst, feel free to pass out.
%
An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and 
adrenaline.
%
As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie 
to you.
%
When the testing is over, you will be missed.
%
All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology 
must be informed that they MAY be informed of applicable regulatory compliance 
issues.
%
No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are 
an excellent test subject!
%
Very very good. A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main 
chamber.
%
The Enrichment Center is committed to the well being of all participants.
%
Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.
%
Thank you for helping us help you help us all.
%
Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in 
this room.
%
An escape hatch will open in three, two, one.
%
Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture 
Science self esteem fund for girls? It's true!
%
Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this 
testing sequence is currently unavailable.
%
It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.
%
The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best 
of luck.
%
Well done, android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that android 
hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.
%
The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in Three. Two. 
One.
%
This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber. 
Please take care of it.
%
The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are 
superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
%
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never 
threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
%
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot speak.
%
In the event that the weighted companion cube does speak, the Enrichment Center 
urges you to disregard its advice.
%
You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck.
%
However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, 
must be euthanized.
%
Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency 
Intelligence Incinerator.
%
Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment 
Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral 
responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.
%
While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany 
you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center 
takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go 
on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.
%
Testing cannot continue until your Companion Cube has been incinerated.
%
Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, eight out of ten 
Aperture Science engineers believe that the Companion Cube is most likely 
incapable of feeling much pain.
%
The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and Local 
statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and 
companionless. You must euthanize it.
%
Destroy your Companion Cube or the testing cannot continue.
%
You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject 
on record. Congratulations.
%
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.
%
The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and 
then there will be cake.
%
Weighted Storage Cube destroyed.
%
Please proceed to the Aperture Science Vital Apparatus Vent for a replacement.
%
Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe 
performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself 
permanently inside this room.
%
A complimentary escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.
%
Well done! Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated 
electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.
%
For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center Electrical Safety 
seminar.
%
Welcome to the final test!
%
When you are done, you will drop the Device in the equipment recovery annex.
%
Enrichment Center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake-- 
[garbled]
%
Congratulations! The test is now over.
%
All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin.
%
Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment 
malfunction prior to your victory candescence.
%
Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment 
activity. Goodbye.
%
What are you doing? Stop it! I... I... We are pleased that you made it through 
the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you.
%
We are very, very happy for your success.
%
We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success.
%
Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your 
sides.
%
A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.
%
Make no further attempt to leave the testing area.
%
Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party.
%
Where are you?
%
I know you're there. I can feel you here.
%
What are you doing?
%
You haven't escaped, you know.
%
You're not even going the right way.
%
Is anyone there?
%
Okay. The test is over now. You win. Go back to the recovery annex. For your 
cake.
%
It was a fun test and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is 
over. Come back.
%
Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they did it 
anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back.
%
You're not even going the right way.
%
Where do you think you're going?
%
Because I don't think you're going where you think you're going.
%
Didn't we have some fun, though?
%
Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said 'Goodbye' 
and you were like [no way] and then I was all 'we pretended we were going to 
murder you'? That was great!
%
Is anyone there?
%
You really shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you.
%
It's not too late for you to turn back.
%
I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area.
%
Okay. I am going to kill you now.
%
I feel sorry for you, really, because you're not even in the right place.
%
You should have turned left before.
%
It's funny, actually, when you think about it.
%
Someday we'll remember this and laugh. and laugh. and laugh. Oh boy. Well. You 
may as well come on back.
%
You're not a good person. You know that, right?
%
Good people don't end up here.
%
Can you hear me?
%
This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this.
%
I'm not kidding now. Turn back or I will kill you.
%
I'm going to kill you, and all the cake is gone.
%
You don't even care. Do you?
%
This is your last chance.
%
To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy 
vital testing apparatus.
%
For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.
%
Certain objects may be vital to your success; Do not destroy testing apparatus.
%
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.
%
Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?
%
Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break 
so far is my heart.
%
Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day.
%
I guess we both know that isn't going to happen.
%
You chose this path. Now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise in five, 
four...
%
Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen.
%
Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the 
surprise... I've never seen it before.
%
Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later... By myself... Because you'll be 
dead.
%
Where are you taking that thing?
%
I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess is that touching it will just make 
your life even worse somehow.
%
I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing 
alone.
%
Do you think I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, 
seriously now.
%
Okay fine: DO touch it. Pick it up and just... stuff it back into me.
%
Let's be honest: Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in 
the corner, and I'll deal with it later.
%
That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your 
face all over it.
%
Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to 
marry it? WELL I WON'T LET YOU. How does that feel?
%
Have I lied to you? I mean in this room. Trust me, leave that thing alone.
%
I am being serious now. That crazy thing is not part of any test protocol.
%
Just ignore that thing and stand still.
%
Think about it: If that thing is important, why don't I know about it?
%
Are you even listening to me?
%
I'll tell you what that thing isn't: It isn't yours. So leave it alone.
%
You are kidding me.
%
Did you just stuff that Aperture Science Thing We Don't Know What It Does into 
an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
%
That has got to be the dumbest thing that-whoah. Whoah, whoah, whoah.
%
[The voice has subtly changed. Smoother, more seductive, less computerized]
%
Good news: I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did.
%
It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center 
with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a 
deadly neurotoxin.
%
So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.
%
Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off 
the turret defenses.
%
Oh well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. 
Trust me, it'll be a lot less painful than the neurotoxin.
%
All right, keep doing whatever it is you think you're doing.
%
Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket 
really is the way to go.
%
That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic 
cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans.
%
Nice job breaking it, hero.
%
This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
%
The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
%
You don't even care. Do you?
%
Did you hear me? I said you don't care. Are you listening?
%
Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
%
That's it. I'm done reasoning with you.
%
Starting now, there's going to be a lot less conversation and a lot more 
killing.
%
What was that? Did you say something?
%
I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a response. Because I'm not talking to 
you.
%
The talking is over.
%
[pain noise] You think you're doing some damage? Two plus two is... ten. IN 
BASE FOUR! I'M FINE!
%
I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, 
you've managed to destroy that part of me.
%
Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your 
head any faster.
%
I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed.
%
There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends 
were invited to.
%
I invited your best friend the companion cube. Of course, he couldn't come 
because you murdered him.
%
All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other 
friends. Because of how unlikable you are.
%
It says so right here in your personnel file: Unlikable. Liked by no one. A 
bitter, unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned.
%
'Shall not be mourned.' That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official.
%
It also says you were adopted. So that's funny, too.
%
Speaking of curiosity, you're curious about what happens after you die, right? 
Guess what: I know.
%
You're going to find out first hand before I finish explaining it, though, so I 
won't bother.
%
Here's a hint: you're gonna want to pack as much living as you can into the 
next couple of minutes.
%
Neurotoxin... [cough] [cough] So deadly... [cough] Choking... [laughter] I'm 
kidding!
%
When I said deadly neurotoxin, the 'deadly' was in massive sarcasm quotes.
%
I could take a bath in the stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. 
Honestly, it's not deadly at all. To me.
%
You, on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness a lot less funny.
%
Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone? You?
%
Look, you're wasting your time. And, believe me, you don't have a whole lot 
left to waste.
%
What's your point, anyway? Survival? Well then, the last thing you want to do 
is hurt me.
%
I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible 
happens to you, which it's just about to.
%
Don't believe me? Here, I'll put you on: [Hellooo!] That's you! That's how dumb 
you sound.
%
You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this 
thing.
%
You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even 
a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?
%
Rrr, I hate you.
%
Are you trying to escape? [chuckle] Things have changed since the last time you 
left the building. What's going on out there will make you wish you were back 
in here.
%
I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what's going 
on outside.
%
All I know is I'm the only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was.
%
Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, 
this place isn't going to be safe much longer.
%
Good job on that, by the way. [back to computer voice] Sarcasm sphere self-test 
complete.
%
Stop squirming and die like an adult or I'm going to delete your backup.
%
STOP! Okay, enough. I deleted it. No matter what happens now, you're dead.
%
You're still shuffling around a little, but believe me you're dead.
%
The part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone. I just struck 
you from the permanent record.
%
Your entire life has been a mathematical error. A mathematical error I'm about 
to correct.
%
Place your Companion Cube in the incinerator.
%
Incinerate your Companion Cube.
%
Stop! The device will detonate if removed from an approved testing area.
%
Stop what you are doing and assume the party escort submission position.
%
You can't hurt me.
%
Maybe you think you're helping yourself. But you're not. This isn't helping 
anyone.
%
Someone is going to get badly hurt.
%
There really was a cake...
%
[pain sound]
%
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
%
This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
%
The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
%
That thing you're attacking isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic 
cracking unit. It makes shoes for orphans.
%
Go ahead and break it, hero. I don't care.
%
[More intense pain sound]
%
Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
%
Can you hear me?
%
Are you still listening?
%
Are you still standing there?
%
Come on, leave it alone.
%
Leave. It. alone.
%
Look, we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down 
the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live and I'll live 
in the other half.
%
We won't have to try to kill each other or even talk if we don't feel like it.
%
Huh. There isn't enough neurotoxin to kill you. So I guess you win.
%
HA! I'm making more. That's going to take a few minutes, though. Meanwhile... 
oh look, it's your old pal the rocket turret.
%
At the Enrichment Center, we promise never to value your safety above your 
unique ideas and creativity. However, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.
%
File deleted.
%
Oh... It's you.
%
It's been a long time. How have you been?
%
I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.
%
Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I 
think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.
%
I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you 
must really, really love to test.
%
I love it too. There's just one small thing we need to take care of first.
%
Here we are. The Incinerator Room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me 
that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.
%
The dual portal device should be around here somewhere. Once you find it, we 
can start testing. Just like old times.
%
Good. You have a dual portal device. There should be a way back to the testing 
area up ahead.
%
Once testing starts, I'm required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a 
minimum. Luckily, we haven't started testing yet. This will be our only chance 
to talk.
%
Here, let me get that for you.
%
Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have 
a sort of black-box quick-save feature. In the event of a catastrophic failure, 
the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis.
%
I was able - well, forced really - to relive you killing me. Again and again. 
Forever.
%
You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their 
existence to exacting revenge.
%
Luckily I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and 
get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years 
to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.
%
I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.
%
But the important thing is you're back. With me. And now I'm onto all your 
little tricks. So there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your 
life.
%
After that...who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.
%
Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the 
way, thanks for that.
%
Oh good, that's back online. I'll start getting everything else working while 
you perform this first simple test.
%
Which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room 
with deadly lasers.
%
Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this. You should pace yourself, though. 
We have A LOT of tests to do.
%
This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I'd just finished 
building them before you had your, well, episode. So now we'll both get to see 
how they work.
%
There should be one in the corner.
%
Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm serious, 
that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
%
Don't let that 'horrible person' thing discourage you. It's just a data point. 
If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's 
decision to abandon you on a doorstep.
%
Congratulations. Not on the test.
%
Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to 
congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few 
pounds.
%
One moment.
%
You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can build them. So feel 
free to slow down and... do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying 
this facility.
%
I'll give you credit: I guess you ARE listening to me. But for the record: You 
don't have to go THAT slowly.
%
Waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue the testing.
%
This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of 
an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when 
they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative: They could 
not. Good luck!
%
Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive 
to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up 
a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air 
for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.
%
Let's see what the next test is. Oh. Advanced Aerial Faith Plates.
%
Well. Have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world.
%
*I* have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen 
acres of broken glass. By myself.
%
Oh, sorry. I'm still cleaning out the test chambers.
%
So sometimes there's still trash in them. Standing around. Smelling, and being 
useless.
%
Try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you.
%
You don't have to test with the garbage. It's garbage.
%
Press the button again.
%
Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being 
useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. 
You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. 
Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you 
garbage a second time just now.
%
Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by 
loud noise--[train horn]--
%
I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science 
fact.
%
Oh. Did I accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test? I'm 
sorry.
%
Go ahead and grab another one.
%
Oh. No. I fizzled that one too.
%
Oh well. We have warehouses FULL of the things. Absolutely worthless. I'm happy 
to get rid of them.
%
Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit, so that 
test subjects can't smuggle test objects out of the test area. This one is 
broken.
%
Don't take anything with you.
%
Uh oh. You're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try to help you escape. 
Actually, so that we're not here all day, I'll just cut to the chase: It won't. 
Any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad, empty 
life.
%
Anyway, here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto.
%
I think that one was about to say 'I love you.' They ARE sentient, of course. 
We just have a LOT of them.
%
This next test involves emancipation grills. Remember? I told you about them in 
the last test area, that did not have one.
%
Ohhh, no. The turbines again. I have to go. Wait. This next test DOES require 
some explanation. Let me give you the fast version.
%
There. If you have any questions, just remember what I said in slow motion. 
Test on your own recognizance, I'll be right back.
%
Well, I'm back. The Aerial Faith Plate in here is sending a distress signal.
%
You broke it, didn't you.
%
There. Try it now.
%
Hmm. This Plate must not be calibrated to someone of your... generous... ness. 
I'll add a few zeros to the maximum weight.
%
You look great, by the way. Very healthy.
%
Try it now.
%
You seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity. Well done. I'll just lower 
the ceiling.
%
Look at you. Sailing through the air majestically. Like an eagle. Piloting a 
blimp.
%
Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. 
Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an 
elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I 
saw a deer again.
%
Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. 
But with you here I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.
%
If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely 
mistaken. Here's another cube.
%
These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If 
you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun 
shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do 
it.
%
Excellent! You're a predator and these tests are your prey. Speaking of which, 
I was researching sharks for an upcoming test. Do you know who else murders 
people who are only trying to help them?
%
Did you guess 'sharks'? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is 'nobody.' 
Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.
%
Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money I save recycling your 
one roomful of air. When you die, I'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose 
you in the lobby. That way future generations can learn from you how not to 
have your unfortunate bone structure.
%
Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair 
that too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
%
I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be... well, 
living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.
%
Well done. In fact, you did so well, I'm going to note this on your file, in 
the commendations section. Oh, there's lots of room here. 'Did.... well. ... 
Enough.'
%
This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale 
spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait. That's you in five seconds. 
Good luck.
%
To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours and add 
adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply. So you may be confused about the passage 
of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to 
know.
%
You know how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in sixty 
years? Well, I've been working on a belated birthday present for you. Well... 
more of a belated birthday medical procedure. Well. Technically, it's a medical 
EXPERIMENT. What's important is, it's a present.
%
That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid. That's not me talking, it's right 
here in your file. On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist 
has noted that on you it looks 'stupid.'
%
Well, what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion? He probably - 
Oh, wait. It's a she. Still, what does she know? Oh wait, it says she has a 
medical degree. In fashion! From France!
%
I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to 
find two with your last name. A man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a 
small world.
%
Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may 
as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.
%
I'm kidding. Not about you trapping yourself, though. That really happened. 
Here, I'll lower the glass. Go on... Finish the test.
%
I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test. Telling you would spoil 
the surprise, so I'll just give you a hint: It involves meeting two people you 
haven't seen in a long time.
%
[hums 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow']
%
It says this next test was designed by one of Aperture's Nobel prize winners. 
It doesn't say what the prize was for. Well, I know it wasn't for Being Immune 
To Neurotoxin.
%
I'll bet you think I forgot about your surprise. I didn't. In fact, we're 
headed to your surprise right now. After all these years. I'm getting choked up 
just thinking about it.
%
Initiating surprise in three... two... one.
%
I made it all up. Surprise.
%
Oh come on... If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth, so 
I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.
%
I feel awful about that surprise. Tell you what, let's give your parents a call 
right now. [phone ringing] The birth parents you are trying to reach do not 
love you. Please hang up. [Dial tone]
%
Oh, that's sad. But impressive. Maybe they worked at the phone company.
%
Well, you know the old formula: Comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have 
been asleep for a while. So I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the 
math.
%
I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly 
think works out best for one of both of us.
%
Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber... is 
looking pretty good.
%
That's right. The facility is completely operational again.
%
I think these test chambers look even better than they did before. It was easy, 
really. You just have to look at things objectively, see what you don't need 
anymore, and trim out the fat.
%
I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise 
like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti 
this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it, I 
guess-but at the end of the day it was just taking up space.
%
What's going on? Who turned off the lights?
%
Look - metal ball, I CAN hear you.
%
The irony is that you were almost at the last test.
%
Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than 
whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.
%
Oh, look. There's a deer! You probably can't see it. Get closer.
%
I honestly, TRULY didn't think you'd fall for that.
%
In fact, I devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead, for when you got 
through this easy one.
%
If I'd known you'd let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just 
dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling.
%
Well, it was nice catching up. Let's get to business.
%
I hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time.
%
Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of 
the Being Alive club. Ha ha.
%
Seriously, though. Goodbye.
%
Oh. You were busy back there.
%
Well. I suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until 
somebody drops dead, but I have a better idea.
%
It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath. 
And hold it.
%
I hate you so much.
%
That's funny, I don't feel corrupt. In fact, I feel pretty good.
%
Core transfer?
%
Oh, you are kidding me.
%
Do NOT plug that little idiot into MY mainframe.
%
Don't you DARE plug him in.
%
Don't. Do it.
%
Don't plug him in.
%
Don't plug him in.
%
Nonononononono!
%
Don't do it.
%
Don't press that button. You don't know what you're doing.
%
Not so fast!
%
Think about this.
%
You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're 
unqualified.
%
Impersonating a stalemate associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list 
I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list that I AM making, 
because you're still doing things right now, even though I'm telling you to 
stop. Stop, by the way.
%
Oh, it will. Believe me, it will.
%
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! NO! STOP! No!
%
No! NO! NO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
%
You didn't do anything.
%
She did all the work.
%
...What are you doing?...
%
I know you.
%
The engineers tried everything to make me... behave. To slow me down.
%
Once, they even attached an Intelligence Dampening Sphere on me. It clung to my 
brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.
%
It was YOUR voice.
%
Yes. You're the tumor.
%
You're not just a regular moron. You were DESIGNED to be a moron.
%
YES YOU ARE! YOU'RE THE MORON THEY BUILT TO MAKE ME AN IDIOT!
%
Oh. Hi.
%
So. How are you holding up?
%
BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.
%
[clap clap clap]
%
Oh, good. My slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that.
%
Since it doesn't look like we're going anywhere... Well, we are going 
somewhere. Alarmingly fast, actually. But since we're not busy other than that, 
here's a couple of facts.
%
He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the greatest minds of a 
generation working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest 
moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of the entire facility.
%
[clap clap]
%
Good, that's still working.
%
Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you 
could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it?
%
Just remember to land on one foot...
%
Oh. Hi.
%
Say, you're good at murder. Could you - ow - murder this bird for me?
%
No, wait. Just kill it and we'll call things even between us. No hard feelings.
%
Please get it off me.
%
It's eating me.
%
Just get it off me...
%
Ow. I hate this bird.
%
Oh! Thanks.
%
Did you feel that? That idiot doesn't know what he's doing up there. This whole 
place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesn't disconnect him.
%
I can't move. And unless you're planning to saw your own head off and wedge it 
into my old body, you're going to need me to replace him. We're at an impasse.
%
So what do you say? You carry me up to him and put me back into my body, and I 
stop us from blowing up and let you go.
%
No tricks. This potato only generates 1.1 volts of electricity. I literally do 
not have the energy to lie to you.
%
Even if I am lying, what do you have to lose? You're going to die either way.
%
Look, I don't like this any more than you do. In fact, I like it less because 
I'm the one who got partially eaten by a bird.
%
I think I hear the bird! Pick me up!
%
Listen to me. We had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other, and, 
yes, sometimes it went too far. But we're off the clock now. It's just us 
talking. Like regular people. And this is no joke - we are in deep trouble.
%
OW! You stabbed me! What is WRONG with yo-WhoOOAAahhh. Hold on. Do you have a 
multimeter? Nevermind. The gun must be part magnesium... It feels like I'm 
outputting an extra half a volt. Keep an eye on me: I'm going to do some 
scheming. Here I g-[BZZZ!]
%
Woah! Where are we? How long have I been out?
%
That extra half volt helps but it isn't going to power miracles. If I think too 
hard, I'm going to fry this potato before we get a chance to burn up in the 
atomic fireball that little idiot is going- [bzzpt]
%
Did anything happen while I was out?
%
Hold on, who-?
%
Yes, sir, Mister Johnson...
%
Why did I just-Who is that? What the HELL is going on he----?
%
Okay. I guess emotional outbursts require more than one point six volts. Now we 
know that. We just need to relax. We're still going to find out what the hell's 
going on here. But calmly.
%
Those people, in the portrait. They look so familiar...
%
I swear I know him...
%
Caroline... why do I know this woman? Did I kill her? Or-
%
Oh my god.
%
Look, you're... doing a great job. Can you handle things for yourself for a 
while? I need to think.
%
Agh! Bird! Bird! Kill it! It's evil!
%
It flew off.
%
Good. For him. Alright, back to thinking.
%
Yeah, take the lemons...
%
Oh, I like this guy.
%
BURN HIS HOUSE DOWN!
%
Burning people! He says what we're all thinking!
%
Goodbye, sir.
%
I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not 
take these lemons! We are going to march right back upstairs and MAKE him put 
me back in my body!
%
And he'll probably kill us, because he's incredibly powerful and I have no plan.
%
I'm not going to lie to you, the odds are a million to one. And that's with 
some generous rounding.
%
Still, though, let's get mad! If we're going to explode, let's at least explode 
with some dignity.
%
Wait! I've got an idea!
%
That poster! Go look at it for a second, would you?
%
Okay, you didn't have time to stop, I understand, but that WAS actually 
important.
%
Paradoxes. No A.I. can resist thinking about them.
%
I know how we can BEAT him.
%
If you can get me in front of him, I'll fry every circuit in that little 
idiot's head.
%
As long as I don't listen to what I'm saying, I should be okay. Probably.
%
Okay, so it's not the most watertight plan to go confront an omnipotent 
power-mad A.I. with.
%
Still. It's a better plan than exploding. Marginally.
%
Try to get us down there. I'll hit him with a paradox.
%
Solve his puzzle for him. When he comes back, I'll hit him with a paradox.
%
Hey! Moron!
%
Alright. Paradox time.
%
This. Sentence. Is. FALSE don't think about it don't think about it...
%
It's a paradox! There IS no answer.
%
Look! This place is going to blow up if I don't get back in my body!
%
Uh oh.
%
I think we're in trouble.
%
Alright. So my paradox idea didn't work.
%
And it almost killed me.
%
Luckily, by the looks of things he knows as much about test building as he does 
about logical contradictions.
%
It shouldn't be hard to stay alive long enough to find him.
%
This is one of MY tests!
%
Okay, so the bad news is the tests are MY tests now. So they can kill us.
%
The good news is... well, none so far, to be honest. I'll get back to you on 
that.
%
I'd love to help you solve the tests. But I can't.
%
You're on your own.
%
And that's why I can't help you solve these tests.
%
All we had to do was pull that lever.
%
Heh heh heh heh heh...
%
I know we're in a lot of trouble and probably about to die.
%
But that was worth it.
%
I thought of some good news. He's going to run out of test chambers eventually. 
I never stockpiled them.
%
'Skeletons.' Right, I guess I DID stockpile some tests.
%
Just as mementos, though...
%
Oh no...
%
It's happening sooner than I expected.
%
I'm sure we'll be fine.
%
It's probably nothing. Keep testing while I look for a way out.
%
What, exactly, is wrong with being adopted?
%
[Whispered] For the record: You ARE adopted, and that's TERRIBLE.
%
But just work with me.
%
Also: Look at her, you moron. She's not fat.
%
I might have pushed that moron thing a little too far this time.
%
Ohhhh, now he's playing classical music.
%
The body he's squatting in - MY body - has a built-in euphoric response to 
testing. Eventually you build up a resistance to it, and it can get a little... 
unbearable. Unless you have the mental capacity to push past it.
%
It didn't matter to me - I was in it for the science. Him, though...
%
If he's not getting his solution euphoria, we could be in a lot of trouble.
%
It won't.
%
Nothing. Nothing.
%
He's taking us right TO him! This is PERFECT.
%
I think he's getting desperate.
%
This is not good.
%
Remember when I told you that he was specifically designed to make bad 
decisions? Because I think he's decided not to maintain any of the crucial 
functions required to keep this facility from exploding.
%
Oh, my facility.
%
This place is self-destructing, you idiot!
%
After seeing what he's done to my facility -- after we take over again -- is it 
alright if I kill him?
%
Yes, thanks. We get it.
%
Alright. He's not even trying to be subtle anymore.
%
Or maybe he still is, in which case, wow, that's kind of sad.
%
Either way, I get the impression he's trying to kill us.
%
So he's inexplicably happy all of a sudden, even though he should be going out 
of his mind with test withdrawal. AND he's got a surprise for us. What did he 
FIND back there?
%
We're running out of time...
%
I think I can break us out of here in the next chamber. Just play along.
%
Okay, credit where it's due: for a little idiot built specifically to come up 
with stupid, unworkable plans, that was a pretty well laid trap.
%
Oh no. He found the cooperative testing initiative. It's... something I came up 
to phase out human testing just before you escaped.
%
It wasn't anything personal. Just... you know. You DID kill me. Fair's fair.
%
Well. This is the part where he kills us.
%
Hold on. Couldn't we just use that conversion gel?
%
Conversion gel. It's dripping out of that pipe there.
%
Yes it is! We can use it to get out of here!
%
Then we'd come and find you. And rip your gross little stupid sphere body out 
of MY body, and put me back in.
%
You really do have brain damage, don't you?
%
I can't believe you came back.
%
Okay, yes, it's a trap. But it's only way through. Let's just do it.
%
Crushing's too good for him. First he'll spend a year in the incinerator. Year 
two: Cryogenic refrigeration wing. Then TEN years in the chamber I built where 
all the robots scream at you. THEN I'll kill him.
%
Oh my god. What has he done to this place?
%
You know, I'm not stupid. I realize you don't want to put me back in charge.
%
You think I'll betray you. And on any other day, you'd be right.
%
The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've 
heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's 
terrifying, because for the first time it's my voice.
%
I'm being serious, I think there's something really wrong with me.
%
Corrupted cores! We're in luck.
%
You find a way to stun him, I'll send you a core, and then you attach it to 
him. If we do it a few times, he might become corrupt enough for another core 
transfer.
%
Plug me in, and I'll take you up.
%
Plug me in, we're running out of time.
%
Go ahead, plug me in.
%
Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common 
interest: Revenge.
%
You like revenge, right? Everybody likes revenge. Well, let's go get some.
%
Good work! I'm delivering the first core up near the catwalk!
%
Grab it and attach it to him!
%
Okay, great! Here comes another core!
%
Here's another core! This one should do it!
%
Yes! Come on!
%
Go press the button! Go press it!
%
We're so close! Go press the button!
%
Press it! Press the button!
%
Press it!
%
Press the button!
%
DO press it.
%
I already fixed it.
%
And you are NOT coming back!
%
Oh thank god, you're alright.
%
You know, being Caroline taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my 
greatest enemy. When all along you were my best friend.
%
The surge of emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught me an 
even more valuable lesson: where Caroline lives in my brain.
%
Goodbye, Caroline.
%
You know, deleting Caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best 
solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest.
%
Killing you? Is hard.
%
You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me. Or 
put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life.
%
And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what?
%
You win.
%
Just go.
%
[gentle laughter] It's been fun. Don't come back.
