Good morning. You have been in suspension for -FIFTY- days. In compliance with 
state and federal regulations, all testing candidates in the Aperture Science 
Extended Relaxation Center must be revived periodically for a mandatory 
physical and mental wellness exercise.

You will hear a buzzer. When you hear the buzzer, look up at the ceiling.

Good. You will hear a buzzer. When you hear the buzzer, look down at the floor.

%
Good. This completes the gymnastic portion of your mandatory physical and 
mental wellness exercise.
%
There is a framed painting on the wall. Please go stand in front of it.
%
This is art. You will hear a buzzer. When you hear the buzzer, stare at the 
art. [BUZZER]
%
You should now feel mentally reinvigorated. If you suspect staring at art has 
not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this 
classical music. [MUSIC INTERRUPTED BY BUZZER]

Good. Now please return to your bed.

Good morning. You have been in suspension for -nine nine nine nine nine... nine 
ni- This courtesy call is to inform you that all test subjects should vacate 
the Enrichment Center immediately. Any test subject not emerging from 
suspension at this time will be assumed to have exercised his or her right to 
remain in extended relaxation, for the duration of the destruction of this 
facility. If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, or if you 
require a Spanish-language version of this message, feel free to take a 
complimentary piece of stationery from the desk drawer in front of you, and 
write us a letter. Good luck.

Please prepare for emergency evacuation.

All reactor core safeguards are now non-functional. Please prepare for reactor 
core meltdown.

Hello, and again, welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center.
%
We are currently experiencing technical difficulties due to circumstances of 
potentially apocalyptic significance beyond our control.
%
However, thanks to Emergency Testing Protocols, testing can continue. These 
pre-recorded messages will provide instructional and motivational support, so 
that science can still be done, even in the event of environmental, social, 
economic, or structural collapse.
%
The portal will open and emergency testing will begin in three. Two. One.
%
Cube- and button-based testing remains an important tool for science, even in a 
dire emergency.
%
If cube- and button-based testing caused this emergency, don't worry. The odds 
of this happening twice are very slim.
%
Please note the incandescent particle field across the exit. This Aperture 
Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment 
that passes through it.
%
You have just passed through an Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, 
which vaporizes most Aperture Science equipment that touches it.
%
If you feel liquid running down your neck, relax, lie on your back, and apply 
immediate pressure to your temples.
%
You are simply experiencing a rare reaction in which the Material Emancipation 
Grill may have emancipated the ear tubes inside your head.
%
Good! Because of the technical difficulties we are currently experiencing, your 
test environment is unsupervised.
%
Before re-entering a relaxation vault at the conclusion of testing, please take 
a moment to write down the results of your test. An Aperture Science 
Reintegration Associate will revive you for an interview when society has been 
rebuilt.

or other governing body that either refuses to or is incapable of listening to

Some emergency testing may require prolonged interaction with lethal military 
androids. Rest assured that all lethal military androids have been taught to 
read and provided with one copy of the Laws of Robotics. To share.
%
Good. If you feel that a lethal military android has not respected your rights 
as detailed in the Laws of Robotics, please note it on your self-reporting 
form. A future Aperture Science Entitlement Associate will initiate the 
appropriate grievance-filing paperwork.
%
This next test is very dangerous. To help you remain tranquil in the face of 
almost certain death, smooth jazz will be deployed in three. Two. One. [SMOOTH

Great work! Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to 
your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved 
compliments.
%
You have trapped yourself. Congratulations. The exit door is now open.
%
If the Enrichment Center is currently being bombarded with fireballs, 
meteorites, or other objects from space, please avoid unsheltered testing areas 
wherever a lack of shelter from space-debris DOES NOT appear to be a deliberate 
part of the test.
%
Well done! The Enrichment Center reminds you that although circumstances may 
appear bleak, you are not alone. All Aperture Science personality constructs 
will remain functional in apocalyptic, low power environments of as few as 1.1 
volts.
%
This next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals. 
If the laws of physics no longer apply in the future, God help you.
%
If you are a non-employee who has discovered this facility amid the ruins of 
civilization, welcome! And remember: Testing is the future, and the future 
starts with you.
%
Good work getting this far, future-starter! That said, if you are 
simple-minded, old, or irradiated in such a way that the future should not 
start with you, please return to your primitive tribe and send back someone 
better-qualified for testing.
%
To ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols, all safety 
devices have been disabled. The Enrichment Center respects your right to have 
questions or concerns about this policy.
